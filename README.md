# SKUOEdit
3D Ultima Online TileMap Editor made with Unity

Heavy WIP, Partly useable, i don't recommend using it in production yet though and you'll have to compile it yourself

About Statics:
- Statics are not planned to be available anytime soon, for now the editor will be only for the map without statics
